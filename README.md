# School-District-Analysis-PyCitySchools
Mod 4 Challenge
## Overview of the School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine how the students are performing at 15 different high schools in a certain area. This analysis attempts to determine if there are any trends or correlation in the data to determine how high school students will perform on math and reading tests. This also excludes data that is potentially altered from 9th grade students at Thomas High School.
## Results
* **How is the district summary affected?** ![District Summary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101011641/161463874-61931102-88d4-4364-9bf9-f8f0a839e494.png)
  * This is the updated district summary. The averages and percentages are not affected much by the removal of the 9th grade Thomas High School students scores. 
* **How is the school summary affected?** ![Per School Summary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101011641/161464293-1a0a5160-3d6a-49df-912f-f2129f3706aa.png)
  * The average math score for Thomas High School is slightly lower (by approximately 0.06 points) and the average reading score is slightly higher (by approximately 0.05 points).
* **How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?** 
  * It does not dramatically affect their performance. As stated above, the average math score drops by about 0.06 points and the average reading score increases about 0.05 points. It doesn't even affect their ranking as the second highest performing school in this district

* **How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:**
  * **Math and reading scores by grade:** Replacing the ninth grade scores eliminated the 9th grade category for Thomas High School

## Summary
The changes that happened with the removal of the reading and math scores from the 9th grade class at Thomas High School was not significant. The average math score changed from an 83.418349 to an 83.350937, the average reading score changed from an 83.848930 to an 83.896082, the % passing math changed from a 93.272171% to a 93.185690%, and the % passing reading changed from a 97.308869% to a 97.018739%. 
If the values were altered, then it is not statistically significant enough to prove that they were purposefully altered, or that they were even altered in the first place.
